<h2 id="projects">Some interesting work I've been engaged in...</h2>

<p><a href="video-surveillance.html">Video Surveillance</a> - In this work, we find the groups (or clusters) present in a scene and their activities. We then utilize these group activities along with the scene context to recognize the scene activity.</p>

<p><a href="video-surveillance.html">Opthalmology</a> - We at Samsung developed multiple technologies for remote eye health care reusing old Galaxy smartphones that are no longer of use. Our focus was not only solving a health issue, but a growing environmental concern as well.</p>

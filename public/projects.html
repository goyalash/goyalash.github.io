<h2 id="projects">Some interesting work I've been engaged in...</h2>

<p><a href="video-surveillance.html">Video Surveillance</a> - In this work, we find the groups (or clusters) present in a scene and their activities. We then utilize these group activities along with the scene context to recognize the scene activity.</p>

<p><a href="visual-acuity.html">Opthalmology</a> - We at Samsung developed multiple technologies for remote eye health care reusing old Galaxy smartphones that are no longer of use. Our focus was not only solving a health issue, but a growing environmental concern as well.</p>

<p><a href="">Robotics</a> We at SINAPSE lab, Singapore designed an algorithm based on space-time event data induced by moving and stationary objects in neuromorphic vision sensor
mounted on a mobile robot in a swarm setup. It is a challenging task since space-time events are created by movements of the platform (self-movement) as well as other moving robots.</p>

<p><a href="">Malnutrition Tracker</a> - In collaboration with Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas (CTARA) we developed a mobile camera based solution to measure height of the children, one of the two major clinical indicators of malnutrition.</p>
